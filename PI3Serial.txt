$ sudo nano /boot/config.txt

and add the line (at the bottom):
enable_uart=1

Disable console
$ sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
$ sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service

You also need to remove the console from the cmdline.txt. If you edit this with:
	
$ sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

you will see something like:

	
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes root wait

remove the line: console=serial0,115200 and save and reboot for changes to take effect.

At this point I was able to get serial data from ultrasonic sensor on GPIO 15 using 
minicom -b 9600 -o -D /dev/ttyS0

These instruction use miniuart for GPIO 14,15 to disable bluetooth and use hardware serial port see instructions at URL above
